The City of New York would like to develop a Data Analytics platform on Azure Synapse Analytics to accomplish two primary objectives:

Analyze how the City's financial resources are allocated and how much of the City's budget is being devoted to overtime.
Make the data available to the interested public to show how the Cityâ€™s budget is being spent on salary and overtime pay for all municipal employees.

For this project, I will work in the Azure Portal, using several Azure resources including:

Azure Data Lake Gen2 (Storage account with Hierarchical Namespaces checkbox checked when creating)
Azure SQL DB
Azure Data Factory
Azure Synapse Analytics

The Azure Data pipelines will be connected Github.
